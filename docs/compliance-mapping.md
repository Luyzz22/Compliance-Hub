# Compliance Mapping: DSGVO, EU AI Act, GoBD, E-Rechnung

## DSGVO Controls

- Record of Processing Activities trigger on personal-data documents
- Third-country transfer alerts for non-DACH suppliers
- Human approval checkpoint before final legal record publication

## EU AI Act (Operational Readiness)

- AI output classification: draft vs. approved compliance artifact
- Human oversight mandatory for high-impact compliance decisions
- Traceability via action log + audit hash per document
- Model risk management pathway prepared via decision logging hooks

## GoBD

- Immutable archival event per ingested document
- Hash + timestamp generation for auditability
- Preparation for process documentation exports

## E-Rechnung

- XRechnung/ZUGFeRD expected as normative formats
- Validation failure causes posting stop and correction workflow
- Supplier feedback loop prepared through actionable error states
